        title : 'Running On A Regular Basis Improves Your Health',
        
        data : 
        `Believe it or not, running is actually a great way to increase your overall level of health. Research shows that running can raise your levels of good cholesterol while also helping you increase lung function and use. In addition, running can also boost your immune system and lower your risk of developing blood clots.`,
        
        detail: 
        `       
        The new study focused on a group of more than 55,000 men and women ages 18 to 100. About a quarter of them were runners. Over 15 years, those who ran just 50 minutes a week or fewer at a moderate pace were less likely to die from either cardiovascular disease or any cause, compared with those who didn’t run at all.
        
        The study suggests a relatively low entry level for the benefit of jogging, but it is not a prescription. “A little bit is good but a little bit more is probably better,” Dr. Baggish says. A 2013 study in Denmark suggested that the “sweet spot” for maximum longevity is up to 2.5 hours of running a week.
        
        Although running can trim away some of your existing risk of cardiovascular disease, it doesn’t entirely eliminate it. The combined effect of lifestyle, diet, and family history still contribute to your lifetime risk.
        
        “There is no question that the fitter you are and the more exercise you do, the longer you live and the better your quality of life,” Dr. Baggish says. “But it doesn’t confer immunity.”

        This study used preventing death to measure the benefit of running, but it’s not the most typical reason for running. “Many dedicated long-term runners do not run because they want to live longer,” Dr. Baggish notes. “They run because it makes them feel better on a daily basis. There is a mood elevating, quality-of-life benefit that comes from being a regular exerciser.”
        
        For regular runners, the cost of feeling good can be strains and sprains, so Dr. Baggish advocates for the value of what he calls “active rest.” His rule of thumb, not supported by any specific research, is that it’s a good idea to spend 25% of exercise time over the course of a year running at a lower level of intensity or doing other activities like swimming or biking.
        
        “The body responds to training, but to preserve that benefit over the long haul there needs to be active periods of recovery,” Dr. Baggish says. “Pulling back allows the body to repair and heal.”`

        title : 'A Daily Run Can Help Lower the Risk of Breast Cancer in Women',
        data : `For women, running can actually help to lower your risk of breast cancer. It can also help reduce the risk of having a stroke. Many doctors today recommend running for people who are in the early stages of diabetes, high blood pressure, and osteoporosis, and it is proven to help reduce the risk of having a heart attack.`,
        detail:`
        Whether you log a marathon or a single city block, running—even slowly—may greatly reduce the risk of a cardiovascular-related death when compared to people who do not run, says a new study published Monday in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.
        
        The U.S. government and the World Health Organization currently suggest either 150 minutes of moderate-intensity (brisk walking, gardening or physical chores around the house) or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise (running, cycling, swimming or competitive sports) per week.  Yet very little research exists looking at the benefits of vigorous exercise below 75 minutes.
        
        Researchers examined data from the Aerobics Center Longitudinal Study to see if there was a connection between running and longevity. The research followed more than 55,000 adults between the ages of 18 and 100 over a period of 15 years, recording their daily activity, including running. They found that the benefits of running were the same regardless of sex, age, weight, health conditions and substance-use history, with all runners showing a 30% lower risk of death from all causes, and a 45% lower risk of death from a heart attack or stroke. 
        
        Out of the original sample of people, 1,217 died of cardiovascular disease—and only 24% of them reported running as part of their exercise routine.`

        title : 'Running Can Help You Lose Weight',
        data : `Running is one of the best forms of exercise for losing or maintaining a consistent weight. You will find that it is a leading way to burn off extra calories and that it is the second most effective exercise in terms of calories burned per minute, following only after cross country skiing.`,
        detail: `
        Cross-training is important for a few reasons: First off, it makes you a stronger runner and reduces your risk of injury. “Running is only hard on your joints if you don’t have the muscle to support them,” Rubin says. Secondly, lifting will help you lose weight. “The more lean muscle mass you have, the more calories you’ll burn at rest,” she says. That's right, more muscle means more burned calories when you're just sitting around. 
        
        To get started, try these 10 essential strength exercises for runners. Yes, athletes are constantly optimizing their training plans and race-day strategies, but you don’t need to go crazy if you’re just starting out. “When it comes to weight loss, moving and burning calories are what matters,” O’Connor says. 
        
        “If you like sprints, which have a higher rate of calories burned per minute, then have at it; but if you prefer walking or slower jogging, you’ll just need to spend more time to burn those calories.”
        
        That said, a Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise study found that runners lost more weight than walkers over a six-year period, possibly because of the afterburn effect. “Running at a high intensity will create an afterburn, which is when your body continues to burn calories when you’re no longer moving,” Rubin says. She suggests starting with three 30-minute runs a week, sprinting for 30 seconds then recovering for 30 seconds to a minute.

        title : 'Running Boosts Your Confidence',
        data : `Not all of the benefits of running are physical. Running can provide an noticeable boost to your confidence and self-esteem. By setting and achieving goals, you can help give yourself a greater sense of empowerment that will leave you feeling much happier.`,
        detail: ` When it comes to running, there are several ways you can boost your confidence quickly. Some potential ideas are as follows:
        
        Design and execute a workout with easily achievable goals: Many training programs include workouts that incorporate target paces or times, be it through intervals, tempo runs, pace runs, or even full-out time trials.  
        
        If you find yourself missing your goals in such workouts, take the next few instances and set an easier goal – shorten your distance, reduce your pace goal, or both.
        
        If you set a target you can actually exceed, you can start to build a path of small wins that can give you the confidence to build your goals back to the original levels.
        
        Start finishing your workouts strong: It is possible to finish nearly any type of workout with a confidence-boosting burst of strength to leave you feeling positive and excited for your next training endeavor.  From intervals to long runs, there are a range of “finish strong” techniques, generally involving progressive splits (whereby you increase your speed as the workout progresses) that not only improve your physical conditioning, but make you mentally tougher and help keep you focused on successfully executing the workout.
       
        Mix up your training routines: If you are like many runners, you are following a training plan that puts your tempo run on Tuesday, your long run on Saturday, or something similarly consistent.  While there are many good reasons for the design of these plans (such as alternating hard and easy days, putting long runs on the weekend when you have more time), they can get a bit stultifying if followed to the tee.  If you occasionally shuffle things around, or mix in a new type of cross-training, you may be able to break the monotony of your training and start regaining confidence.  
        
        Even running at a different time of day can provide new incentive, and you may find you are faster in the afternoon than, say, in the predawn.

        title : 'The Importance of Relieving Stress',
        data : `Stress can actually cause a number of health and mood problems. It can also diminish appetite and sleep quality. When you run, you force your body to exert excess energy and hormones.  Running also helps to reduce your chances of developing tension headaches.`,
        detail: `
        As you probably figured, there are some psychological benefits for runners as well. Stress in both its forms, acute and long-term, have some pretty nasty effects on your body. 
        
        Acute stress comes on fast and typically doesn't last very long. It can be triggered by anything, from an auto accident to bumping into an old flame you weren't prepared to see. 
        
        Most of your body systems are negatively affected by acute stress. Your brain, lungs, heart, immune system and digestive system all ramp up to deal with whatever trigger got you so worked up, whether it's a real danger or just perceived. Long-term, or chronic, stress is even worse. Over time, your heart will have to work overtime, and your immune system will weaken and send your fat straight to your waistline. Arthritis, heart disease, diabetes and aging all take a hit when you live with chronic stress.
        
        It is important to manage your stress and running can help you do so.
