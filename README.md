## Key Features

* User Signup / Login using SQLite
  - Easy registration and account management
  
* Stopwatch with laps
  - For a runner, knowing your personal best time for a lap, as well as knowing how long it generally takes you to complete a lap at your favourite track is important. Pacemaster allows you to keep track of multiple laps and provides you an easy option to reset your laps if you have made a mistake or need to simply clear all your entries.
  
* Map of local running tracks
  - You may know that you want to run, and that it is good for your health, however not knowing the best places to run and where your local tracks are can be frustrating. Pacemaster delivers a map with markers indicating all the local running tracks in a userâ€™s area, allowing them to select one that they prefer or simply select the one that is nearest to them.
  
* Calories burned / distance walked calculator
  - If starting a weight loss program with the aide of running, it is valuable to know how many steps you are taking in your runs and how many calories you are burning. Pacemaster features a built-in calculator that does this for you, providing easy access to information that helps make dieting and running decisions.
